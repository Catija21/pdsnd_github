# R-Project | Exploring Bikeshare Data
## November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2021

### Project Overview
The project is about using _R_ to Explore the data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We will be answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year
